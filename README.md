# Insight-Coding-Challenge
Files corresponding to the Insight Data Science Data Engineering Coding Challenge
Instructions: 

1) In the input section of the repository for the challeng https:/github.com/InsightDataScience/edgar-analytics/tree/master/input place all csv input files.

2) When running the code contained in my file (output file.cpp) the code will direct the user to enter the full path of each test file. For example, if the input file is "input.csv", enter

                    https://github.com/InsightDataScience/edgar-analytics/tree/master/input/input.csv
                    
3) The output will be written in the file output.txt

            https://github.com/tonyache/Insight-Coding-Challenge/blob/master/output.txt
            
4) The main file (C++) is here: output file.cpp

                    https://github.com/tonyache/Insight-Coding-Challenge/blob/master/output%20file.cpp

5) Make sure that the name of the inactivity file is precisely "inactivity.txt"
